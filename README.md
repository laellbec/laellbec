## Hi there,
My name's Lael Bec and I'm a computer science student at the University of Victoria. Below are some projects that I feel highlight my skills that I've learned over the past two years.

## Projects:
### [DynaSurvey: Efficient Data Processing](https://github.com/laellbec/DynaSurvey)
- **Description**: Refactored and improved a survey system in C to enhance efficiency, modularity, and maintainability. Implemented dynamic memory allocation, modular design, and filtering capabilities for survey data.
- **Key Skills**: C programming, dynamic memory management, modular design, version control (Git), automated build processes (Makefile).
- **Outcome**: Successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating robust data handling and filtering capabilities.

### [Medical Clinic System GUI](https://github.com/laellbec/MedicalClinic)
- **Description**: Developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a medical clinic system using PyQt6. The GUI allows users to manage patients, create and update patient records, and handle patient notes, all while adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
- **Key Skills**: Python, PyQt6, MVC design, GUI development, data persistence (JSON/Pickle), modular programming.
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented all user stories, ensuring a user-friendly and functional interface for managing clinic data.
